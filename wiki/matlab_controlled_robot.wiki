==='robot' an overview===
There are many variations in definitions of what exactly is a robot. Therefore, it is sometimes difficult to compare number of robots in different countries. To try to provide a universally acceptable definition, the International Organisation for Standardisation gives a definition of robot in ISO 8373, which defines a robot as "an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose, manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications." 

  Matlab is the world's most recommended programming language for mathematical computations.
There are a plenty of control system designs in matlab for controlling robot. ascent has already developed a fuzzy neuro control system for a guided vehicle to operate in underground coal mines. 


==objectives==

Matlab is the world's most recommended programming language for mathematical computations. It is very convenient to design complex control system for controlling robots in matlab. But in order to implement these control systems, the code has to be converted to c language to be burnt on to the microcontroller used in the robot. Many a times, if not always, the control system is too heavy in terms of memory consumption and process power requirement for a microcontroller system to work with. Hence it would be good idea if the control system is implemented in matlab in a pc and by establishing a duplex link between robot and the pc. 
  The objective of this project is to design a robot which can be controlled from matlab environment. The robot is to have two traction wheels and by varying the angular velocity of the wheels, the direction and speed of the robot can be controlled.  A microcontroller take care of controlling these wheels. The microcontroller has also to be designed for receiving serial data through it's UART port. A function is to be developed in matlab which sends out four different codes to the robot, through its serial port. The four code words are stop, move forward, move right and move left.

==Literature Review==

===matlab===
MATLAB is a numerical computing environment and programming language. Created by The MathWorks, MATLAB allows easy matrix manipulation, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs in other languages. Although it specializes in numerical computing, an optional toolbox interfaces with the Maple symbolic engine, allowing it to be part of a full computer algebra system.

 It is used by more than one million people in industry and academia A North American individual commercial license costs US$1900 (MATLAB only), while a license for student use costs US$99 (MATLAB, Simulink and Symbolic Math). 

====History====

Short for "MATrix LABoratory", MATLAB was invented in the late 1970s by Cleve Moler, then chairman of the computer science department at the University of New Mexico. He designed it to give his students access to LINPACK and EISPACK without having to learn Fortran. It soon spread to other universities and found a strong audience within the applied mathematics community. Jack Little, an engineer, was exposed to it during a visit Moler made to Stanford University in 1983. Recognizing its commercial potential, he joined with Moler and Steve Bangert. They rewrote MATLAB in C and founded The MathWorks in 1984 to continue its development. These rewritten libraries were known as JACKPAC.

      MATLAB was first adopted by control design engineers, Little's specialty, but quickly spread to many other domains. It is now also used in education, in particular the teaching of linear algebra and numerical analysis, and is the de facto choice for scientists involved with image processing. 

====Limitations====

MATLAB is a proprietary product of The MathWorks, so users are subject to vendor lock-in.

      The language shows a mixed heritage with a sometimes erratic syntax. For example, MATLAB uses parentheses, e.g. y = f(x), for both indexing into an array and calling a function. Although this ambiguous syntax can facilitate a switch between a procedure and a lookup table, both of which correspond to mathematical functions, a careful reading of the code may be required to establish the intent.

Many functions have a different behavior with matrix and vector arguments. Since vectors are matrices of one row or one column, this can give unexpected results. For instance, function sum(A) where A is a matrix gives a row vector containing the sum of each column of A, and sum(v) where v is a column or row vector gives the sum of its elements; hence the programmer must be careful if the matrix argument of sum can degenerate into a single-row array. While sum and many similar functions accept an optional argument to specify a direction, others, like plot, do not, and require additional checks. There are other cases where MATLAB's interpretation of code may not be consistently what the user intended (e.g. how spaces are handled inside brackets as separators where it makes sense but not where it doesn't, or backslash escape sequences which are interpreted by some functions like fprintf but not directly by the language parser because it wouldn't be convenient for Windows directories). What might be considered as a convenience for commands typed interactively where the user can check that MATLAB does what the user wants may be less supportive of the need to construct reusable code.

      Though other datatypes are available, the default is a matrix of doubles. This array type does not include a way to attach attributes such as engineering units or sampling rates. Although time and date markers were added in R14SP3 with the time series object, sample rate is still lacking. Such attributes can be managed by the user via structures or other methods.

Array indexing is one-based which is the common convention for matrices in mathematics, but does not accommodate the indexing convention of sequences that have zero or negative indices. For instance, the DFT (or FFT) is defined with the DC component at index 1 instead of index 0, which is not consistent with the standard definition of the DFT. This one-based indexing convention is hard wired into MATLAB, making it impossible for a user to define their own zero-based or negative indexed arrays to concisely model an idea having non-positive indices.

      MATLAB doesn't support references, which makes it difficult to implement data structures that contain indirections, such as open hash tables, linked lists, trees, and various other common computer science data structures. In addition, since the language is consistently call-by-value, it means that functions that modify array or object values must return and assign those modified values for the change to be persistent.
