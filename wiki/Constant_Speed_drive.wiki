* INTRODUCTION*
              The purpose of a motor speed controller is to take a signal representing the demanded speed, and to drive a motor at that speed.It detects and controls the rotational speed of the motor. When lower than the specification speed, it increases a control electric current. When higher than the specification speed, it reduces a control electric current. It is possible to use when wanting to keep constant speed even if the load to the motor changes.
The speed of a DC motor is directly proportional to the supply voltage, so if we reduce the supply voltage from 12 Volts to 6 Volts, the motor will run at half the speed.
The speed controller works by varying the average voltage sent to the motor. It could do this by simply adjusting the voltage sent to the motor, but this is quite inefficient to do. A better way is to switch the motor's supply on and off very quickly. If the switching is fast enough, the motor doesn't notice it, it only notices the average effect.
