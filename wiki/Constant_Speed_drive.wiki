#summary Drive the dc motor in a specified speed irrespective of the load.

= Introduction=

 The purpose of a motor speed controller is to take a signal representing the demanded speed, and to drive a motor at that speed.It detects and controls the rotational speed of the motor

  When lower than the specification speed, it increases a control electric current. When higher than the specification speed, it reduces a control electric current. It is possible to use when wanting to keep constant speed even if the load to the motor changes.
=DESCRIPTION=

  The speed of a DC motor is directly proportional to the supply voltage, so if we reduce the supply voltage from 12 Volts to 6 Volts, the motor will run at half the speed.

  The speed controller works by varying the average voltage sent to the motor. It could do this by simply adjusting the voltage sent to the motor, but this is quite inefficient to do. A better way is to switch the motor's supply on and off very quickly. If the switching is fast enough, the motor doesn't notice it, it only notices the average effect.
  
 The on-off time  of DC motor can be controlled by PWM technique.PWM controls use pulse width modulation to regulate the current sent to the motor.

=principle of operation=

the principle of operation inthis project is pulse width modulation. in order to avoid the sray signals in the receiving end TSOP1738(38 kHz) is used. according to the squre puse generated by astable multi vibrator, ir led transmit this pusle and it is received by tsop.
 

==ALGORITHM==

 # Start
 # Read the input key
 # switch on the motor
 # If signal=1,inc count 
    else compare count and keyread
 # If count<keyread,switch off the motor
    else switch on the motor
 # If count>keyread,go to step3
    else switch off the motor





Program 
 {{{
