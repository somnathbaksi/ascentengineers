You have said that I don’t have a focus. I don’t know whether you are pretending that you don’t understand or really you do not understand me. Anyway I don’t mind explaining again, what my objective is (this time more explicitly).

> You have asked me to maintain ‘ I am ok you are ok status’ so as to have a logical discussion. In the previous mail itself I have spoken about the difference between studying a subject and feeling a subject, which is basically a matter of neural network in the brain. So a vague statement that, the perfect status of a human being is’ I am ok you are ok’ once again confirms your attitude of speaking something from a textbook before comprehending (feeling) it. I have heard the heads of organized religions and political parties speaking like this. ‘As it is written in this book or as Nehru has said this, it must be true.’ it might be true, but I being an idiot often think too much before accepting something.

So you have said that I posses ‘I am ok you are not ok’ status and let us assume that it is true. Now, you are also in the same status. Else you would have thought like this: manoj is not that much intelligent. So he speaks like this. So let me make him clear that he is wrong . It is only by using logic that I could make him know that. I must not say that he is an idiot, just like that. I must make him understand it.

If you thought like this, you wouldn’t have used certain terms, which were not logical, but were emotional. (Proof: you have said ‘I don’t want to waste time talking with you’)


> I will speak from that space. Yes, the perfect status for a human growth is ‘I am ok you are ok’, which I am saying not because that Thomas Harris has said it, but by my logic regarding the evolution of a human being to that status.

The perfect example of this status could be Jesus, and let us analyze how he reached that status. He didn’t reach that status all of a sudden. Let us forget the question of whether he felt that he is not ok when he was young or not, because that will be off context. At a certain point of time in his life he felt that certain things in the society are wrong. He felt wrong with many others (existing dogmas, the preachers of those dogmas) around him when he was a grown up man.

So, he felt that he is ok and many are not ok.  This status has driven Jesus to propose Christianity. If he were feeling that he as well as the world is ok then there is no need to propose Christianity.

Any successful person (materialistic sense), who gets good marks, scores a goal in football etc may at times feel this often.
But then, how could you differentiate his emotions and the emotions of a person who scored a goal?

That is where my logic starts. His status of I am ok you are not ok is a social one where as the psychological status was different. When the society sees him, he asks people to change from what they think, he speaks against certain things etc. so from social perspective, his status is ‘ I am ok you are not ok’

Now from the psychological perspective let us view it. If Jesus were psychologically believing that he is ok and others are not ok, he would have simply ignored the preachers of the dogmas and would have said that you are lesser person, or that you don’t deserve my reply or so. He would never put forward his points, but would simply say that he is a great person and others are nothing. But he didn’t do it, as he was psychologically (unconsciously) believing that others are also ok. So he tried his level best to use logical language to make others know him, believing that they are also ok and a day would come when they would understand him. He pointed examples and used logic to say that others were wrong.

Now let us consider psychological perspective of the man who believes that he is ok and others are not ok, as he has scored a few goals in his last match. He won’t speak about why feels that he is right, instead he just repeats that he is right. He would say that others blabber when they play football, but never says why he thinks like that. Or in other words, he won’t speak rationally about it.

If his status were based on logical facts and not the goals he scored, then even if he appears as ‘I am ok you are not ok’ person in social views, psychologically he would be a very much true political person. He would be confident for an intellectual dual based on facts and logic rather than emotional statements. He would never speak that he is great; instead he speaks on reasons, which make him great.

Another symptom of the footballer is this: he would drop his ideologies (his ok status) when his opponent scores goals.

So a person, who is political like Jesus, would stand for his idea and would communicate it logically for the comprehension of everyone. He would try to talk from the fundamentals so that others could understand him. The footballer would talk for something in a vague manner without rational explanation when he scores goal and would drop it once his opponent scores back (when atheists don’t give encouragement).


Anyway, my simple objective is this:  I have talked about certain points, which make me believe that the cluster needs a correction. I got a footballer’s reply for my query. I again spoke and I again got the same. If I get a logical answer, I could correct myself if I am wrong. Else, I will talk and talk to the footballers and would beg for their ears. And a day would come when they would lend me ears, comprehend me and would talk logically. That day would be the birthday of the real ‘share learn evolve’.
