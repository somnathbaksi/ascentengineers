# Introduction #
# It survived just for a flash, we call it share learn evolve #
The process called share learn evolve has had its demise in the womb itself, and many among you may think that I may be happy because what I blabbered at the time of the genesis of this process is now appearing as a kind of prophecy. What I said during the initial phase of the initiative lacked explanation, and hence this elaboration.

_> rather than speaking about me, let me speak about the team comprising of jemshid, nithin, junise and sooraj; because at this juncture i am confident to say that we have grown enough to understand each other._

_rather than a program, share learn evolve is a process which proves our existence. probably those workshops on wednesdays are the only expression of the process share learn evolve visible to lesser beings._

_and "blabbery" is never a prophesy, but i am sure that you will have followers who will attribute prophecy to "blabbery". that is why we have a lot ലാട വൈദ്യന്മാര്‍ , ജ്യോതിഷക്കാര്‍ etc through out the world._

The spokesmen of the process may claim that it is still a persisting process. Though I know that they don’t think much about relevant things, I can’t prove that handicap, as the thinking process is part of a man’s private gray matter, or in better words, thinking is a micro social activity. But, share learn evolve is something meant for intelligent debates, or it is a macro social activity (both e discussions as well as non e discussion), which I could surely prove as a non-existing stuff, as of now.

_it is the same team with the same motive has contributed to the rejuvenation of fsug calicut after a gap of 8 years. the same group is organising four workshops on 14th , 15th and 16 th at 4 different locations on free software. the same team is the second largest contributor to the freedom walk after zyxware. in addition to that a typical share learn evolve day was planned to be held at nitc calicut but postponed due to nac accreditation team visit._




> But the demise has stimulated a very different thought stream in my brain (njaale cheriyeee buddhi), which I believe could deduce reasoning for the demise as well as a few remedial measures for the redemption of the process.


# Prologue #



Categorization of human beings based on their pleasure generating/ excitement levels could be a vague process, but in general, I strongly believe that basically there are two kinds of people as far as ambitions are concerned. One is the generally present group, and the members of that group have the layman’s ambitions- to get strokes from the society and fellowmen and thus forget their inferiority complex. Majority of human beings group themselves under this family where as the other group, has a much higher pleasure threshold, so that they derive pleasure only by doing the most weird (as the others say) things. Ambani, Edison or s.c.d could be examples of people in this group.

_one has to be very care full before attempting a generalisation, or else it might end up to be foolish like the generalisation of social structure by communists._

Share learn evolve is a ritual being done by the laymen group. So, as of now, we are in no interest in thinking about s.c.d, or the idiotic way reshmi reciprocates to a very interesting message from him, which causes immense confusions in his mind.

I am using transactional analysis terms, which is a totally new subject for me, for the analysis. Though I have felt that subject, I have started studying its terminology only last week. The states of human mind according to transactional analysis, which we need for analysis of the demise, are:

Parent- simply could be defined as ‘ valyettan’... _be careful with this definition. parent is the valyettan part of ones own psycho personality_

Adult- the rational being....

Child- they are of two types...

Good child- it is not that he is good, but he obeys his valyettan, or he is a good shinkidi. Kalabhavan mani’s role in naatturajavu could be a definition.

The bad child might be rebel or fun loving person, who disobeys the valyettan. Mohanlal in ‘dasaratham’ could be a definition.

_let me elaborate on ta. a single person and to be better the psychological person comprises of parent, adult and child and not just ta entity. and as per ta, we need classify the transaction as adult to adult, parent to child, child to adult etc._

The cluster- the group which remains as the embodiment of share learn evolve. Jemshid, nithin, junise.

The anti cluster- the group opposing the cluster. Kapil. This group in disguise has acted as the major factor for the survival of the cluster.

# The analysis #

# Evolution of Jemshid #

He has the feeling of inferiority (I am not O.K status)
Proof: My friends and me went to meet a person with whom jemshid had a discussion.

The person: why didn’t you go for a multi national company job?
Jemshid: to do interesting job (factual answer- tried many other things, couldn’t excel there)
The person: is ascent a business establishment?
Jemshid: (pause for 20 seconds) ascent is a community. (Factual answer- (spontaneously) yes it is a business establishment. It is a tuition center)
_ascent is evolving into a community_
During the conversation, he has lied so as to make himself feel O.K or in other words forget his inferior feeling.

_there is not even a single lie in the conversation. the job is interesting and that is why we all, the team remain together and continue to work and surviving on a low revenue. each every member in the team has options._

He tries to forget his not O.K status by behaving like his parental figures (those whom he admires).
Proof: jemshid gets irrelevant calls from his wife, Sony and from science trust. He has seen busy businessmen (his parental figure) getting continuous calls, and hence he feels himself O.K when he gets calls like that. When the next call comes he says to call later, and says that if he couldn’t pick the call, they are supposed to send an sms (as his parental figure, the businessmen say). But the reasons for his failure to pick calls often are (not his busy schedule of work)
1.	He would be sleeping during wrong hours
2.	He would be watching movie

He wants to behave like his parental figures so as to get rid of his inferior feeling, and thus he contaminates his rational and does all rubbish things.

_whatever, i would love to receive email. and don't expect me to attend all phone calls. in case i don't attend the call and the call is important, let me reiterate, send me an sms, or give me three miss calls, i will call back_


# Evolution of nithin: #

He has the feeling of inferiority (I am not O.K status). He wants to get stroke, which is the basic nature of child. If he were an adult, he would have reciprocated logically to many of my technical doubts. He could clarify my query, or could say that he doesn’t know the answer. But he ignores it. _a few deserve it_ I would then kindle his interest by uttering a half-statement-“ you are so special because………” Then he thinks that I am about to praise him and all of a sudden he would watch me with dilated eyes, which reminds me a K.G student.
The better explanation of his child psych could be the intense fear, which he had, when a person called Tony, in whom he sensed a competitor for his intellectual throne, entered into hyderbad ace.

Unlike jemshid, he never imitates his parent, because he has set high standards for his parent (like van gogh), which he believes as unapproachably tall figures.
So he needs to be stroked as a child wishes so as to forget his inferiority complex, thus contaminating his own logic.

_nithin will continue to maintain the status "not OK" in terms of knowledge. and it is much better than stopping learning and feeling OK._


# Evolution of junise: #

This guy is terribly under confident. He is such an adaptive child; he would end up as the good child, the shinkidi of his parent. He feels O.K by being the shinkidi.
> Proof: his body language could easily prove that he is an adaptive child. When he argues with kapil, he looks on the floor.

Another proof could be this. I asked him a doubt regarding free software. Instead of comprehending my doubt, he simply said that ‘ free software is a great thing and hence any doubt regarding it is irrelevant’ _another mode of ignoring those who deserve it_ (though I had a rational debate on the subject with others in the field, later through telephone).


If it were a year back he would have remained silent, but now he runs away from his inferior feeling by becoming a good shinkidi of his parent. Thus he half-confidently talks with people, not because that he learned something new in the span of one year, but because of the security feeling he possesses from the care he gets from his valyettan. He proudly argues for his parent, though he doesn’t know what his parent’s ideology is. _you are getting confused with ta. the ta terminologies have specific meaning and don't confuse with their literal meaning._i would advice you to revise ta theory. first two chapter of thomas harris, first in the series will do

The saddest thing is that, all the members who traverse to the O.K state stay there only for a fraction of a second. Not in more than a short span would they come back to their uneasy state. _i would suggest you to read on "i am ok, you are not ok" status_

The psychology of anti cluster is irrelevant for our discussion and hence we are omitting it. All previous members (I don’t like to mention their names as many are not in the scene now) of anti cluster miserably lacked rational strength, though kapil is an exception. So from here on, I am talking about kapil when I mention anti cluster.
_let me make it clear. only two in the anti cluster have rational strength and they are manoj and kapil_

# The genesis and survival of the cluster/ share learn evolve #

Jemshid imitates his parental figure, to forget his complex. He proposes activities _which contributes to better understanding of the world we live in_, which makes him believe that he is similar to his parent (say, infosys narayanamurthy). Kapil _along with manoj_knows that it is merely an imitation and he reacts. Thus he becomes the bad boy. Jemshid wants to remain the valyettan to stay O.K _(ta error)_, hence seeks good children. Nithin wants strokes, jemshid gives it and hence they form a team. Together they criticize others _that is not what we are interested int_. Jemshid again searches for good children, junise wanted protection and hence they form a team. An additional credential for this process could be stated as- Junise though under-confident, often argues with kapil (often only to him. why doesn't junise shout at mallan?How could mallan be better than kapil according to junise? Junise knows both of them very little,very very little, still he irrationally decides that mallan is a better person), as he is the bad child of his parent.

Thus the cluster happened and survived. But as I have mentioned earlier, the status of being O.K has no rational authenticity and hence the mission has had its demise. _factually wrong_

N.B- I didn’t forget to speak about sooraj, I purposefully have not described him. Paruthiveeran kind of people, crazy characters, severe alcohol and drug addicts were the only tough-to-understand people, for the world. But now I have made my own addition to that group. Sooraj.

# Introduction #

Add your content here.


# Details #

I expect you to speak logically. I know it will take time to crush your prejudice, and get into your adult. Please read carefully what I am scribbling. Please don’t take it emotionally. I want statements with the support of fundamentals. Don’t say that things are like that. You are talking to a person who has a totally different ideological stream from that of yours. So, the only methodology to communicate is to speak, standing in the courtyard of fundamental logic. You might have reached your belief state based on rational thinking (though I don’t believe it. I state it just because I think about possibilities). But to make a person of different politics, comprehend you, you ought to explain properly, which you have forgotten to do. So hence I reply to your very absurd statements.

Jemshid statement:  A perfect child; mine is better than yours or I am better than you

I reply: this being the heading, I hope I would get a logical reasoning for why you believe that my essay lacked logic. If I don’t get reasoning, I would reciprocate at the end of this.


> Jemshid statement: Rather than speaking about me, let me speak about the   team comprising of jemshid, nithin, junise and sooraj; because at this juncture I am confident to say that we have grown enough to understand each other


I reply: I can spot a minimum of 10 instances to counter this argument, but I don’t want to do it, as that will affect the stability of the fragile cluster. Leave your emotions and speak sincerely- do you believe you people do understand each other?? Don’t you remember what all things you have confided to me? But I don’t want to elaborate it. My point is simple. Your explanation lacks logic. How could you prove you understand well? Please articulate logically, don’t say things just like that. Infact you are generalizing things like communists. Anyway, I take back that statement, because I will use it at the last part of my reply, with logical consistency.


Jemshid statement: it is the same team with the same motive has contributed to the rejuvenation of fsug calicut after a gap of 8 years. the same group is organising four workshops on 14th , 15th and 16 th at 4 different locations on free software. the same team is the second largest contributor to the freedom walk after zyxware. in addition to that a typical share learn evolve day was planned to be held at nitc calicut but postponed due to nac accreditation team visit.
I reply: this statement also lacks fundamental logic. You have to let me know, how this thing, which you do is a better effort. You have just made a statement that you do such and such things as if those things are great.
Anyway I will assume that a good effort has the definition: which contributes to the humanity and makes the world a better place to live (don’t want to speak about whether you usually say it sincerely or not)

So this is my logic. It is something like mathematical induction. I know you from 2003. I have seen you involving with various things right from that period. You have spoken valiantly about those things when you were part of those activities and have spoken against other activities. Then all of a sudden you quit them and get into something else, which I don’t mind if the new activity would supplement the initial one. But you have switched to entirely contradictory things just in a time of one night. You often remind me, srinivasan in chinthavishtayay shyamala. The basic emotion, which makes you switch the ideology, is not a logical revelation but your under-confidence.

Proof: you proposed LSSB (I don’t want to elaborate it, I don’t want to see my dear friend being viewed as a buffoon).
Sathyan: kaka, your idea is absurd.
Jemshid: sathyan is an idiot; I will talk about this to the atheists. They are not like you. They are great.
Manoj: do you really plan to go for children festival?
Jemshid: don’t talk rubbish. You don’t know about them

Jemshid travels to ongole, proposes it in the atheist meet. They reject it sarcastically.
Jemshid talks with manoj through phone: atheists are idiots, they are kids. (anyway sathyan remains an idiot to jemshid)

And you drop your so-called high profile idea. I have always seen you dropping things, never accomplishing anything. Why is it so?  Why did you drop your LSSB activity, for which you argued so valiantly (much more than what you do for share learn evolve) all of a sudden (when you didn’t get stroke from atheists)? I have more and more examples.

Anyway, this being deduced based on induction; I don’t want to believe it. So I would believe that your present endeavor is a great effort, though I will have to believe that this is your first great endeavor. Anyway, in future, please don’t say that this activity was an idiotic one, just because that they didn’t give you a chance to speak during a meeting. I wish at least this time; you reach your dream, of getting really busy.





Jemshid statement: there is not even a single lie in the conversation. the job is interesting and that is why we all, the team remain together and continue to work and surviving on a low revenue. each every member in the team has options.

I reply: o man. Please understand what I said, in the right sense. You didn’t work hard to reach this job, knowing that it is interesting. Am I correct? You tried many other things. Am I correct? There you didn’t win. Am I correct? Now you say that you enjoy this work. ( will talk First about you, then about others)

Now again mathematical induction-During each effort ( from 2003), you said that you were terribly enjoying. But then, were you pretending when your eyes were dilated and your hands were in tremor during those days? Or were you pretending when you said your were enjoying? You reach somewhere and say that you are in a paradise. Then you say, it was a hell and your new spot is a paradise. I will be so happy if you were improving when you were shifting your spots. But I had never been happy because it wasn’t ideology, which maneuvered the changes; all transformations were out of escapism. Am I correct?? Would you agree? So though the spots are regularly changing, till now, you were the same (as per induction); but as above, I wish this be a real paradise, which would help you achieve your dream.

Now regarding others’ options I don’t want to talk, because I don’t want to demoralize them. I have the right to speak truth to you, as we know each other very well. What all options do you believe you have in life? But anyway, both of us know about the conviction with which people other than you and prasad dwell in ascent. I think we need not play hide and seek on the subject. Is it clear????


Jemshid statement: whatever, i would love to receive email. and don't expect me to attend all phone calls. in case i don't attend the call and the call is important, let me reiterate, send me an sms, or give me three miss calls, i will call back

I reply: this is your real attitude. You just think about the usage “ whatever”. You have not argued using logic. You have said like a kid jeering at reality. Properly read what I have said and reply. Infact a detailed observation of this statement would help you to correct yourself. Please think about it. anyway , my simple reply is that you have not said about why you hate calls. You often say that you don’t like calls. But when you don’t get calls and others get continuous calls you feel uneasy. Why?


Or I could articulate it differently. Let us forget whether you love calls or email. I wanted to speak about your psychology and not your interests. But you do not understand what I am saying. So think about this logic.

If two persons speak, say sabeesh and myself. We may be talking about something. All of a sudden, you want to put your input into our discussion, though we don’t expect you to do. You wish for involvement everywhere, but you forget that people don’t expect you to involve in certain things. If you meet Sachin tendulkar, initially you would be tensed and would respect him unnecessarily. You would bow your spine, then you would talk without clarity (you talk without clarity when you are tensed.) slowly as days pass, you will be relaxed and you will try to impress him. You will forget that you don’t know cricket, but you start teaching him that subject. If he throws your idea to the dustbin, you would say that Sachin doesn’t know cricket. What do you think about this?



Jemshid statement: nithin will continue to maintain the status "not OK" in terms of knowledge. And it is much better than stopping learning and feeling OK.

I reply: if he were feeling not O.K in terms of knowledge, then why were you forced to shout at him when he often failed to show interest in share learn evolve? But wait, let me complete.

Who would feel grudge towards a more intelligent person like Tony? A person who feels not O.K in terms of knowledge or a person who feels not O.K like a coward and use knowledge to impress people and make himself feel O.K?

But anyway, though nithin uses knowledge in apolitical ways to overcome his not O.K state, he is more intelligent than others in the cluster, and hence his passion for knowledge is not that filthy. I do believe that he has better chances of becoming a real lover of knowledge. I don’t want to give you the proof because, that will make us deviate from the subject.

Jemshid statement: another mode of ignoring those who deserve it. Only a few deserve nithin’s attention

I reply: this is a purely emotional statement from jemshid. I could reply emotionally to this in a much sensible manner like: how do you measure intelligence? By getting into companies, which are your dreams (like TI or AD)? Or getting calls from so-called premier institutes? Or doing a research? Whatever it is, I have always been ready to combat with you people, but you never took it.  But I would love to argue in pure logic language.
I don’t have a proof to say that I deserve nithin’s attention. But regarding junise’s I do have an argument. I asked a doubt to him, which you say as something which deserves bad treatment. I would like to remind you something, which you might have forgotten. After asking that doubt to him, we went to beach hotel. We had a discussion and hope you remember things now. Should I elaborate? You have to agree either of the two things. You contradict yourself or else you have lied now. Don’t tell things just as a child does to win a game, we are debating to reach an understanding.

Jemshid statement: go through TA again
I reply: I don’t understand the problem with the usage valyettan. Have you seen that movie? He is a critical parent as well as nurturing parent to his brothers. That is what I said. I don’t like explaining like a schoolmaster. I don’t swallow things from textbook. I read less and think more.

I will tell you why you say like this. It is merely my opinion and hence please don’t take it emotionally. You don’t feel a subject; instead you study it. You don’t comprehend things in the right method. You are studying things just to get rid of complex. I will say why I think like this.

> Point 1- you borrow ideologies from others without comprehension.

Point 2- you often use ideologies, which you get from weekly, or from books, about which you say, as if it is yours. No problem.( m.n vijayan, mukundan etc)


Now comes my logic based on these points. Two days ago, you made fun of me saying that I used to speak about left-brain and right brain. What I said was this:
Purely logical people, do things like machines. (Mathematical club)
Purely imaginative people do freaky things (some among the ayamees). These groups criticize each other.
> But being genius is the harmony of these two things. You can refer my article in our college magazine, as a document to prove that i have stated it long back. (There is another group which is neither logical nor creative, whom we call as the brainless. Majority fall in this category, and they have beliefs rather than intelligence. )

another day you said to me that the real superhuman is a blend of music and mathematics, and I was happy to see that you have felt it. But later I knew that you didn’t feel it; instead have said it from a novel, as you have read the first few pages. Why did you ignore my statement and speak the same thing when you got it from a book? Simple answer; that book is a branded stuff. So it is not the fact but the pomp of the brand, which attracts you.

So let me conclude. Your reply to my previous posting was like this; you deny certain things, but you have noted why you deny it. Hope you would get me much more logical reasoning for why you deny my statements along with the reply for this posting.


# NB- please don’t edit this, reply in a new page so that others could read our arguments and decide who is right and who is wrong. #
