# Introduction #

microcontroller based gps system for data display




# Details #

It is mainly an embedded project. the main components of this project are an
rf id,a jupiter reciver.

  * how to interface the microcontroller with the GPS receiver

The gps reciver is connected to the RF id which mainly consist of the 8051 microcontroller,
latch,rom , lcd display etc .the basic principle of this process is trilateration.
In trilateration a minimum of 3 to 4 satlites are used to track a particular location on earth . And the corresponding longitude and lattitude of that particular location is displayed by the lcd display. Depending upon the need further subroutines in the program  section  can be added such as velocity of a moving car with a gps reciever  time etc
this can be also used for tracking that car with certain modifications.
