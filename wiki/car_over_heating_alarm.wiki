*AIM*
   To detect the overheating of car engine in order to prevent its damage by an audio indication.
*INTRODUCTION*
   We have used in the circuit a LM35 developed by National Semiconductor and also the circuit includes an amplifier section,a comparator and a 555 Timer for audio production 
   The circuit idea has been taken from EFY.Further modifications are made and developed a suitable circuit. The circuit works and gives an audio indication when the car engine's temperature rises beyond a fixed temperature.Although cars have a temperature gauge they do not give any warning in  case of over heating.It is quite possible to overlook the reading shown by the pointer.
    When the engine is heated beyond a fixed level the engine get damaged quickly.Initially the circuit considered are as shown below.
    Instead of voltage divider by 4.7k and Thermistor G..L..16.We use LM35 because the fore said element is not available widely in electronic shops.
